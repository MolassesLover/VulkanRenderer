# Credits

## Boilerplate

This renderer was made possible thanks to the incredible work done by
[Sascha Willems](https://github.com/SaschaWillems) and **many** other 
contributors on the [Vulkan-glTF-PBR](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan-glTF-PBR), 
and the [Vulkan examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) repositories.

The [Vulkan SDL](https://github.com/naivisoftware/vulkansdldemo) demo by 
[NAP Labs](https://github.com/naivisoftware) helped tremendously in
teaching me CMake, and Vulkan initialisation.

[Alexander Overvoorde](https://github.com/Overv)'s
[Vulkan tutorial](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial) was what made
learning Vulkan a conceivable, achievable, and coherent goal for me.

A massive thank you to the dozens of talented
[contributors](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial/graphs/contributors) 
to that project, as well. 

[@Mori-TM](https://github.com/Mori-TM)'s 
[expansion](https://github.com/Mori-TM/Vulkan-Tutorial-Advanced) upon the original 
[Vulkan tutorial](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial) project 
provided great reference regarding the handling of multiple textures.
